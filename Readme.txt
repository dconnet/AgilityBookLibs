For full git history, see main AgilityBook project.
This code was extracted from there so I could reuse it in other projects.

Note: This is designed to be used within another project. If you use the
Visual Studio projects to build, this will generate a bin directory one
level up from here (so not in this submodule directory). Since these projects
are included in the owning git project, the bin directory ends up in a
reasonable place.
